{# AI altered (chatGPT) of 03.jinja #}The protein with the gene identifier {{gene_id}} has an isoelectric point of {{isoelectric_point|round(2)}}. Solvent accessibility analysis shows that {{sasa|round(2)}}% of its residues are surface-exposed, classifying it as a {{buried_exposed}} protein. In terms of structural composition, it is characterized by {{alpha_percent|round(1)}}% alpha helices and {{beta_percent|round(1)}}% beta sheets. The protein's amino acid makeup is primarily {%for aname in top3_residues%}{{aname}}{%- if loop.length > 1 and not loop.last -%}{%- if loop.revindex0 == 1 %} and {% else %}, {% endif %}{% endif %}{%endfor%}, contributing to {{top3_percent|round(2)}}% of its structure.
