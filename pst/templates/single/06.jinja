{# AI altered version of 05.jinja (chatGPT) #}{{gene_id}}, identified by its gene ID, has a defining isoelectric point (pI) of {{isoelectric_point|round(2)}}. Along with this, solvent accessibility calculations show {{sasa|round(2)}} Ã…ngstroms squared of exposed surface. Structurally, the protein is distinguished by a notable presence of {{ordered_ss[0][0]}} and a considerable proportion of {{ordered_ss[1][0]}}, with its composition being significantly enriched in {{top3_residues[0]}} and {{top3_residues[1]}} amino acids.
