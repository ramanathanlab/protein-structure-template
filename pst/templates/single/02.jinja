{# Generated by hand #}The protein referred to as {{gene_id}} is dominated by {{ordered_ss[0][0]}} ({{ordered_ss[0][1]|round(1)}}%) with significant {{ordered_ss[1][0]}} structures as well ({{ordered_ss[1][1]|round(1)}}%). The amino acid composition shows the most common residue being {{top3_residues[0]}} and {{top3_residues[0]}}. Calculating the pI of the protein shows a charge of {{isoelectric_point|round(2)}}, and calculating the solvent accessible surface area shows an exposed area of {{sasa|round(1)}} Ã…ngstroms.
