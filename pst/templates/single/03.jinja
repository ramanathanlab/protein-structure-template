{# AI generated (chatGPT) #}The protein identified by {{gene_id}} is characterized by {{alpha_percent|round(1)}}% alpha helices and {{beta_percent|round(1)}}% beta sheets with the remaining {{coil_percent|round(1)}}% being coils. The amino acid distribution shows a composition of primarily {%for aname in top3_residues%}{{aname}}{%- if loop.length > 1 and not loop.last -%}{%- if loop.revindex0 == 1 %} and {% else %}, {% endif %}{% endif %}{%endfor%}, contributing to {{top3_percent|round(1)}}% of its structure. The isoelectric point is {{isoelectric_point|round(2)}}. Analysis of solvent accessibility reveals that {{sasa|round(1)}} of it composition exposed.
